## 📌 Overview

Yadder is a smart, AI-integrated project and task planner built with **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **OpenAI**. Whether you're planning a vacation, launching a product, or organizing an event, Yadder helps break down your main idea into structured, actionable tasks grouped into visual "Zones."

For example, you could say:

> _"Create me an itinerary plan for travel in Europe"_

Within seconds, the AI will populate a structured task board – with each **Zone** representing a topic category (e.g., Flights, Hotels, Activities), and each **Action** representing a specific task to complete.
